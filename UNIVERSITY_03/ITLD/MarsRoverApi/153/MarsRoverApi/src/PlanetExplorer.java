		 * The explorer is on a 100x100 grid at location (0, 0) and facing NORTH. 
		 * The explorer is given the commands "ffrff" and should end up at (2, 2) facing East.

		 * The return string is in the format: "(pos_x,pos_y,facing)(obs1_x,obs1_y)(obs2_x,obs2_y)..(obsN_x,obsN_y)" 
		 * Where pos_x and pos_y are the final coordinates, facing is the current direction the explorer is pointing to (N,S,W,E).
		 * The return string should also contain a list of coordinates of the encountered obstacles. No white spaces.
