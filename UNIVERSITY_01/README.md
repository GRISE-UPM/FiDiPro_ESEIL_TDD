# Experiment FiDiPro_ESEIL_TDD_UNIVERSITY_01(2014)

Raw data (subjects' code) for the ESEIL experiment on TDD conducted at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid in 2014.

The code can be downloaded as a single Eclipse workspace. The Eclipse version used to create the repository is Eclipse Luna. The JRE version is 1.7.

Notice that some projects may not compile. The code has been uploaded as received from the experimental subjects. The measurement process implies a series of steps whose starting point is making the code executable. More information is available in **TBD shortly**
